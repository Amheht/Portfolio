## Projects

### 1. [LLMini — Miniature GPT-Style Language Model](/LLMini)

**Summary:**
A lightweight Transformer-based language model (similar to GPT) built from scratch using TensorFlow and Huggingface Tokenizers.
Trained on a curated corpus of classic literature from Project Gutenberg.

**Key Features:**
- Custom Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer
- Decoder-only Transformer architecture
- Token-level next-word prediction training
- Text generation based on prompt continuation
- Modular design for scalability

**Technologies:**  
- TensorFlow
- Python
- Huggingface Tokenizers

### 2. [KnowledgeAssistant — API](/KnowledgeAssistant)

**Summary:**
A lightweight internal knowledge assistant powered by OpenAI and FastAPI.

**Key Features:**
- User registration and login system (bcrypt + JWT)
- Secure token-based authentication
- Upload internal documents for knowledge storage
- Ask questions against uploaded documents (semantic search)
- Document embeddings powered by OpenAI
- Modular, production-grade backend structure

**Technologies:**  
- Python 3.12
- FastAPI (backend API framework)
- SQLite (lightweight database for storage)
- bcrypt (password hashing)
- JWT (token authentication)
- OpenAI API (embeddings and answer generation)
